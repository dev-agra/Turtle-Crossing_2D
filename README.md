Turtle Crossing[2D] is a Vector general Game which was developed using Python Turtle Graphics using Python-3.9.9 which was developed in an effort to recreate 90’s classic High Crossing.
•	Controls: Up arrow only the Turtle doesn’t come back so no turning back!
•	Levels: Every time the turtle crosses the Finish line we move on to the next level where cars    are more random and come at faster speeds.
•	Note: Long press actions are disabled, so if you press arrow once the turtle moves one step ahead, so to Moe faster you need to press the up arrow continuously and faster.
